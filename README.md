# ADX - Authenticated Data eXperiment

This is a working repository for Bluesky's data protocol which we've termed ADX: the Authenticated Data eXperiment. The "X" stands for "experiment" while the project lives in an early exploratory state.

**‚ö†Ô∏èThis is not production-ready or even alpha software. This project is in active development.‚ö†Ô∏è**

---

Please do not try to build anything with this! Interfaces and data structures are likely to radically change, and we took some shortcuts on features still in development (key management, schemas, indexing, to name a few). This experiment is primarily confined to the data & authorization layer with hints at some of the other systems.

We encourage you to [open discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/discussions) with any questions or ideas you have. This code is not meant to be perfect or 100% bug free. Therefore, while we're interested to hear about any problems you may run into (in the form of Issues), we will likely leave them for a larger rewrite and may not be resolving them in the near term.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this project

To learn more about ADX, see:

- [The Architecture document](architecture.md)
- The [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol). 

## üîç What's here?

This is a monorepo containing three packages:

- `common`: This is the adx SDK that contains implementations of:
  - the repository data structure 
  - a sample network namespace (microblogging) with both a full client and delegator client implementation
  - an authorization library for working with adx-capable UCANs
  - some helpers for making calls to a adx data server

- `server`: This is an implementation of a adx server. For simplicity's sake, it actually combines the function of three "roles" in the network:
  - **Identity:** 
    - maintains a mapping of username -> DID
  - **Data:** 
    - maintains a pointer to the latest root CID of a data repository. 
    - verifies the authority of pushes to your repo and updates the root.
    - serves the repository for pulls.
    - acts as a delgatee and makes updates to your repository for properly authorized requests
    - sends updates to other data/indexing servers that have subscribed to a particular DID that it is hosting
  - **Indexing:**
    - stores an indexed version of repositories that it is hosting or that its user's are following
    - returned global view of data including follower lists, aggregated like counts, and user timelines.

- `cli`: This is a basic command line interface for interactions with the adx network:
  - creating a local repository
  - registering a user
  - creating/editing/deleting posts
  - creating/deleting likes
  - viewing a user's timeline
  - viewing a user's feed

  _Note: the cli uses a delegator client at the moment. We are adding the option to use a full client soon._


## üì∫ Demo recording

![demo.gif](./docs/demo.gif)

## üèéÔ∏è Quick use
_Requires Node>=15, and yarn_

Want to jump right in? Follow these steps to get a sample two server network up and running.

This demo takes four terminal windows: 
- two servers to show off data federation (you can use just one here if you like)
- two cli clients representing two users on separate servers interaction

**‚ö†Ô∏è Please note, the server stores data in-memory. If you shutdown and restart a server, your account and related data will be deleted.**

The number in parantheses tells you which terminal to run each command in. From project root:

```bash
# install dependencies
(1) yarn

# build projects
(1) yarn build

# run server
(1) yarn server # runs on localhost:2583

# in a separate terminal, run a second server
(2) yarn server:alt # runs on localhost:2584

# set an env var to store alice's repo in a scoped dir
(3) export ADX_REPO_PATH="~/.adx-alice"

# set an env var to store bob's repo in a scoped dir
(4) export ADX_REPO_PATH="~/.adx-bob"

# register alice
(3) yarn cli init
# prompt with 'alice' for username, 'localhost:2583' for host, true for registration & false for delegator client

# register bob
(4) yarn cli init
# prompt with 'bob' for username, 'localhost:2584' for host, true for registration & false for delegator client

# make a couple posts as alice
(3) yarn cli post "hello world"
(3) yarn cli post "howdy"

# follow alice as bob
(4) yarn cli follow alice@localhost:2583

# like alice's post
(4) yarn cli like alice@localhost:2583 {post_id from alice post} # the post id has the format `3iwc-gvs-ehpk-2s`

# view your timeline
(4) yarn cli timeline

# list your follows
(3/4) yarn cli list follows

# list your followers
(3/4) yarn cli list followers

# list your feed
(3/4) yarn cli feed

# view alice's feed as bob
(4) yarn cli feed alice@localhost:2583

# Keep playing around. Try unliking, deleting or editing posts, or add a third user into the mix! They can be registered to one of the existing servers

# Remember, the servers are running in-memory, if you restart a server and want to restart your CLI as well, run
(3/4) yarn cli destroy # deletes user repo & keypair
```

## Containerized mode
_Requires only docker-compose_

Want to jump right in? Follow these steps to get a sample two server network up and running.

This demo takes two terminal windows: 
- one where the two servers run
- one to issue the cli commands

**‚ö†Ô∏è Please note, the server stores data in-memory. If you shutdown and restart a server, your account and related data will be deleted.**

```bash
# start services
docker-compose up

# now open the second terminal and:

# register alice
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli init
# prompt with 'alice' for username, 'server1:2583' for host, true for registration & false for delegator client

# register bob
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli init
# prompt with 'bob' for username, 'server2:2584' for host, true for registration & false for delegator client

# make a couple posts as alice
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli post "hello world"
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli post "howdy"

# follow alice as bob
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli follow alice@server1:2583

# like alice's post
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli like alice@server1:2583 {post_id from alice post} # the post id has the format `3iwc-gvs-ehpk-2s`

# view your timeline
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli timeline
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli timeline

# list your follows
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli list follows
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli list follows

# list your followers
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli list followers
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli list followers

# list your feed
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli feed
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli feed

# view alice's feed as bob
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli feed alice@server1:2583

# Keep playing around. Try unliking, deleting or editing posts, or add a third user into the mix! They can be registered to one of the existing servers

# Remember, the servers are running in-memory, if you restart a server and want to restart your CLI as well, run
docker-compose exec server1 yarn cli destroy # deletes user repo & keypair
docker-compose exec server2 yarn cli destroy # deletes user repo & keypair
```

## üóíÔ∏è Documentation
We have not put together detailed coumentation for the server API or the SDK because the APIs are expected to change soon.

If you are inclined to play with either, your best bet is to check the tests to see how to use each part of the library.

Specifically:

`server/test/delegator.ts` contains an example of a delegator client (the simplest client to work with)

`server/test/indexer.ts` contains an example of multiple users interaction on a 2 server network

`common/test/repo.ts` contains an examples of directly performing updates to a user repo

`common/test/microblog.ts` contains an examples of using the microblog library to create/update microblog namespace objects in the repository

For communicating directly with the server api, there is a schema above each route that details the exact parameters it expects to receive. Any post route will require a valid UCAN as a Bearer token. We recommend using the SDK to make these requests as these tokens can be difficult to roll by hand.

## üî¶ Notes for code spelunkers
We hope you jump into the code to explore these concepts alongside us! 

As mentioned earlier, please join in the Discussions with questions and ideas. Feel free to report bugs, with the understanding that we may not be resolving them any time soon.

A few notes for the curious ones that find themselves trawling the depths of the code:

### Namespaces

Data is separated in the user repository by namespace.

A user's microblogging data lives separately from their image broadcasting data which lives separately from their long form writing data and so on. Each namespace following its respective data spec.

We've implemented only one sample namespace here: microblogging.

You'll notice that we sometimes switch between using the words "interactions" and "likes". The reason for this is that the user repository speaks in terms of "interactions", which is any sort of interaction generated by an application. These may be likes, retweets, upvotes, shares, rsvps, etc. Our current (simplified) microblogging spec only allows for "likes" as interactions.

Therefore we try to talk about the general concept as "interactions" and the particular as "likes". There is some gray area here where those two concepts blur together and will be better demarcated as we develop our schema system.

### DIDs and UCANs

In this prototype a user's root DID is a simple `did:key`. In the future, these will be more permanent identifiers such as `did:ion` or our currently unnamed consortium-provided DID proposed in the architecture docs. 

The DID network is outside of the scope of this prototype. However, a DID is the canoncial, unchanging identifier for a user. and is needed in ordcer to enable data/server interop.  Therefore we run a very simple DID network that only allows POSTs and GETs (with signature checks). The DID network is run _on_ the data server (`http://localhost:2583/did-network`), however every server that is running communicates with the _same_ data server when it comes to DID network requests. As DIDs are self-describing for resolution, we emulate this by hard coding how to discover a DID (ie "always go to _this particular address_ not your personal data server").

You'll notice that we delegate a UCAN from the root key to the root key (which is a no-op), this is to mirror the process of receiving a fully delegated UCAN _from your actual root key_ to a _fully permissioned device key_.

You'll also notice that the DID for the microblogging namespace is just `did:example:microblog` (which is not an actual valid DID). This is a stand in until we have an addressed network for schemas.

UCAN permissions are also simplified at the current moment, allowing for scoped `WRITE` permission or full-repo `MAINTENANCE` permission. These permissions will be expanding in the future to allow presenting CRUD operations, and more detailed maintenance (ie creation vs merging vs cleanup, etc)

### Client types

In the architecture overview, we specify three client types: full, light, and delegator. This library only contains implementations of full and delegator. Thus we use delegator for light weight operations and a full client when we want the entire repository. 

The main ramification of this is that data server subscribers must receive the _full repo_ of the users that they subscribe to. Once we add in light clients, they can receive only the _sections_ of the repo that they are interested in (for instance a single post or a like) while having the same trust model as a full repo.
